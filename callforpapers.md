  * Representations of goals, constraints, and human preferences  
  * Interaction modalities (language, demonstrations, teleoperation, etc.)

* **Human-Aware Whole Body Motion Planning & Control**
  * Human-aware motion planning and manipulation
  * Safety-aware planning and execution
  * Passive and active effects of robot behavior on humans
  * Social navigation and manipulation

* **Foundation Models for Mobile Manipulation**
  * Large language and vision-language models for task understanding
  * Foundation model-based planning and control

* **Uncertainty and Risk-Aware Decision Making**
  * Uncertainty-aware planning under partial observability
  * Risk-sensitive decision making for human-centered scenarios

* **Shared Autonomy & Responsibility Allocation**
  * Shared autonomy between humans and robots
  * Online human intervention, feedback, and correction

* **Failure Prediction & Recovery**
  * Failure prediction, detection, and recovery
  * Robustness and adaptability in real-world deployment

* **Benchmarks & Evaluation for Human-Centered Manipulation**
  * Large-scale datasets and simulation environments
  * Human modeling and evaluation metrics
  * Benchmarks for human-centered mobile manipulation
